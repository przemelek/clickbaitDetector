**ClickBaitDetector** - Chrome extension which is a test of using machine learning (exactly naive Bayesian classifier and Logistic Regression) to "detect" clickbait articles ;-)

**What's here**
In Bayes folder you will find version of extension code using Bayes classifier, in logisticRegression you will find version of extension which uses Logistic Regression.
Version using Logistic Regression seems to be better.
